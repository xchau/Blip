# Blip

Blip is a visual travel blog for iOS devices. It aims to address the problem of how we currently travel. We're social beings and when we have something cool to share, we can't help but share our experiences with others -- typically on Facebook or Instagram. However, these mainstream social media applications demand much care and attention. This detracts from your experience abroad. Your travels should be about Mai Tais on the beach and not selecting the perfect photo filter to accent your awesomeness. Blip simplifies the process of blogging your adventures and leaves time for you to soak in the sunshine.

3. `yarn`
4. `react-native run-ios`

## Main Features
Blip serves two main functions:
1. It is a personal travel diary that will keep a history of the places you've been, the things you've done and the people you've met.
2. It acts a *"travel recipe"* of sorts, such that others may follow in your footsteps and have the same experiences.

To this end, Blip currently allows users to:
* Create new trip blogs
* Create entries to detail their trip
* Add photos to trips and entries
* Publish/unpublish a trip to share their experiences with others
* View their personal travel history
* Filter through existing trip blogs
* View others' trip blogs and the photos associated with those blogs

## Future Development:
* Favorite and upvote others' trip blogs
* Follow/subscribe to certain users
* Have friend groups
* Chat with other travelers in the same geographic region
* Archive trips instead of publishing them
* OAuth with Facebook and/or Instagram
* Android development

## Technologies Used
1. React Native
2. Xcode
3. Redux
4. Node.js
* ExpressJS
5. PostgresQL
* Knex.js
6. Cloudinary
